# diskomap
At the moment it contains something similar to a key-value collection with saving all operations to a log file for restoring the state, say, when the application is restarted.
Also supports building arbitrary indexes by value.

This crate can be used as a replacement for traditional databases if all the data fits into RAM and you need very fast and competitive data access.

Currently in draft development.
